This file will be updated whenever I have a new idea for a prediction.

Elixir will replace Ruby usage in majority of new apps in 3-4 years.

(Fully) Autonomous cars will have at least 30% market share of new car sales in 10-15 years.

People will use artifical eggs to reproduce in 100-150 years. Maybe even less?
